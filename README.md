# Ladybuy Run

Inspired by a coding toy my son has that is supposed to help him understand concepts from object oriented programming and encourage his skills in problem solving, planning & sequencing and critical thinking.
The application is a game whereby the user:
- selects from a several movement “modules” (up, down, left, right)
- the choices are queued
- when the ladybug is instructed to “execute” instructions, it will move as dictated by modules in sequential (“top down”) order
